# OS Terrain 50 contours

These are **LYRX** files for OS Terrain 50 contours in **Geopackage** format for use in **ArcPro**.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied, downloaded from the OS data hub **from July 2023 onwards**.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Either fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Terrain-50-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) them and navigate to the directory that matches your data format, stylesheet format and style preference.

**2.**  Open ArcPro and in the Map ribbon at the top, under Labeling, select 'more' and ensure that 'Use Maplex Label Engine' is ticked on.

**3.**  Click on the ‘Add Data’ button and navigate to the stylesheets folder and the directory that matches your data format, stylesheet format and style preference.

**4.**  Select the lyrx file and click ‘Add’. Alternatively, you can drag and drop the lyrx file into your Contents pane.

**5**. To fix the data links, click on the exclamation marks. A file explorer window will open. Navigate to where your OS Terrain 50 data is stored and select the data that matches the layer. Alternatively, right click on the layer and go to Properties > On the Source tab click 'Set Data Source'.

Repeat step 5 for all layers if it doesn't fix the other data links automatically.

Your Table of Contents should now look like below. This is the recommended layer order.

We recommend viewing the data between **1:1,000** and **1:200,000** for maximum legibility.
