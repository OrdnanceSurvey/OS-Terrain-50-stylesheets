# OS Terrain 50 contours

These are **QML** files for OS Terrain 50 contours in **Geopackage** format for use in **QGIS**.

*They have been designed to work with the data as it is supplied.*

## Quick start guide

**1.**  Fork or [download](https://github.com/OrdnanceSurvey/OS-Terrain-50-stylesheets/archive/master.zip) the contents of this repository

**2.**  Load your OS Terrain 50 contour Geopackage data into QGIS

**3.**  Double click on a layer to access the 'Layer Properties' window > click on 'Load Style...' > navigate to the directory containing the QML files (those ending .qml) > select the QML file that corresponds to that layer > click 'Open' > click 'OK'

*Repeat step 3 for all layers*

**4.**  We recommend the following layer order:

We recommend viewing the data between **1:1,000** and **1:200,000** for maximum legibility, but turn the points off at scales smaller than 1:50 000 (or activate scale-based visibility under Rendering in the layer label properties).

Your data should now look similar to this:

##Compatibility notes

We strive to make our stylesheets compatible with the latest long-term release of QGIS.
